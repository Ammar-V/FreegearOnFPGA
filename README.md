Welcome to FreeGearToronto, a racing game where you'll be driving on a crazy path in Toronto. 
The objective of the game is to complete the track in the shortest time possible. In this document, 
we will guide you through the steps required to play the game using the DE1-SoC.

## Step 1: Game Controls
In FreeGearToronto, you'll be using the keys on the DE1-SoC board to control your car. The 
controls are as follows:
Key 0 (leftmost) - Move left
Key 1 - Move right
Key 2 - Move up
Key 3 (rightmost) - Reset the game<br>

To move your car left or right, press the corresponding keys. To move up, press the key 2. You 
need to keep the key 2 pressed to move accelerate forward. Press the key 3 to reset the game. 
You'll need to press this key again to restart the game after you've completed it or if you wish to 
start again from the start while in gameplay. 

## Step 2: Gameplay
Once the game has started, your car will start moving automatically. Use the left and right keys 
to steer your car and the up key to accelerate. Try to stay on the track as much as possible, as 
driving on the grass will slow your car down.<br>

As you progress through the game, you'll encounter various obstacles, such as sharp turns and 
narrow passages. You'll need to navigate these obstacles carefully to maximize your game time.

## Step 3: Game Completion
The game is complete when you cross the finish line. Your final time will be displayed on the 
screen. You can choose to reset the game by pressing the key 3.<br>

In conclusion, FreeGearToronto is an exciting racing game that provides a fun and challenging 
experience. With these simple steps, you can start playing the game and aim to beat your best 
time. Remember to use the controls carefully and avoid crashing to complete the game 
successfully.
